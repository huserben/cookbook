1. Install TextLive (https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html)
-> This might take a while...

2. Add Tex Live bin folder to path (e.g. D:\texlive\2021\bin\win32)
Pro tip: Run "kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL" to see your local directory

3. Get emerald font from https://ctan.org/pkg/emerald?lang=en
Extract the font and tex directory to the local text live install (e.g. D:\texlive\texmf-local)

4. Install font (as described here https://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html)

Not sure what the following does, but it worked last time I tried...just run the following commands I guess :-)
Run the commands from the font map directory (e.g. D:\texlive\texmf-local\fonts\map\dvips)

mktexlsr
updmap-sys --force --enable Map=emerald.map
mktexlsr

5. After this start TeXStudio and try to compile and show the cookbook. You should be all set now!
